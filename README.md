## üìã Command Line Options

```
PortSpy - A simple TCP port scanner with colorful output

positional arguments:
  target                Target hostname or IP address to scan

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show help message and exit
  -p PORTS, --ports PORTS
                        Ports to scan (default: common ports)
                        Examples: "80,443", "80-90", "80,443,8000-8010"
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads to use (default: 50)
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Connection timeout in seconds (default: 2.0)
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
  --no-progress         Disable progress bar
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Scanning
```bash
# Scan common ports on Google
python src/portspy.py google.com

# Scan specific ports on local network
python src/portspy.py 192.168.1.1 -p 22,80,443,3389

# Quick scan with shorter timeout
python src/portspy.py example.com --timeout 1
```

### Advanced Scanning
```bash
# High-performance scan with more threads
python src/portspy.py target.com -p 1-1000 -t 100

# Verbose output for debugging
python src/portspy.py localhost -p 80-85 -v

# Quiet mode without progress bar
python src/portspy.py target.com --no-progress
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Run without arguments for interactive prompts
python src/portspy.py

# Example interaction:
# Target (hostname or IP): scanme.nmap.org
# Ports (80,443 or 1-100 or 'common'): 20-30,80,443
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

PortSpy follows a modular architecture with clean separation of concerns:

### Core Modules

## üîß Technical Details

### Scanning Process
1. **Target Resolution**: Validates and resolves hostnames to IP addresses
2. **Port Parsing**: Converts port specifications into scannable port lists
3. **Concurrent Scanning**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel port scanning
4. **Service Detection**: Identifies services using `socket.getservbyport()`
5. **Result Formatting**: Generates professional reports with statistics

### Performance Characteristics
- **Threading**: Configurable thread pool (default: 50 threads)
- **Timeouts**: Per-connection timeout control (default: 2 seconds)  
- **Efficiency**: Typical scan rates of 100-500 ports/second
- **Memory**: Low memory footprint with efficient resource management

### Network Protocols
- **TCP Connect Scan**: Full TCP three-way handshake
- **Port States**: Open, Closed, Filtered, Error detection
- **Service Detection**: System service database integration
